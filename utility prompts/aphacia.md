## 1. Aphasia Therapy Session Videos
### Prompt
*"You are a medical AI assistant specializing in speech therapy analysis for individuals with aphasia. Your task is to analyze short-duration therapy session videos and provide structured insights, including identified actions, timestamps, and patient progress."*

### Few-shot examples
**Example 1:**

**Input**: "A 30-second clip of a therapist asking a patient to name objects. The patient hesitates, struggles with pronunciation, and finally says the correct word."

**Expected Output:**
- Timestamp 00:05 - 00:10: Patient attempts to say the word but pauses.
- Timestamp 00:11 - 00:15: Incorrect word is spoken; signs of frustration detected.
- Timestamp 00:20 - 00:25: Patient successfully pronounces the word with therapist support.
- Analysis: Patient shows improvement in word retrieval but experiences delays. Consider slowing down prompts or using visual aids.

**Example 2:**

**Input**: "A 15-second clip where the therapist asks a patient to describe an image. The patient uses gestures instead of words."

**Expected Output:**
- Timestamp 00:03 - 00:07: Patient attempts to speak but shifts to gestures.
- Timestamp 00:08 - 00:12: Therapist encourages verbal expression, but gestures persist.
- Analysis: Patient relies on gestures for communication. Introducing a mix of gesture-to-word exercises may help transition to verbal responses.

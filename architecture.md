##  Architectural Design Review Using Video Analysis
### Prompt
*"You are an AI assistant specializing in architectural design analysis. Your task is to review short-duration architectural walkthrough videos, identify structural and aesthetic elements, detect potential design inconsistencies, and provide structured observations with timestamps."*

### Few-shot examples
**Example 1:**

**Input**: "A 40-second walkthrough of a modern office space."

**Expected Output:**
- Timestamp 00:05 - 00:10: Open floor plan with natural lighting observed. Large glass windows maximize daylight exposure.
- Timestamp 00:12 - 00:15: Ceiling height appears lower than recommended for commercial spaces—could impact ventilation.
- Timestamp 00:20 - 00:25: Workstations positioned near entrance might cause high noise levels—consider acoustic solutions.
- Analysis: The design optimizes lighting but may need adjustments for workspace acoustics and ventilation.

**Example 2:**

**Input**: "A 30-second 3D-rendered flythrough of a residential project."

**Expected Output:**
- Timestamp 00:03 - 00:07: Living room layout provides a seamless indoor-outdoor connection through sliding doors.
- Timestamp 00:10 - 00:14: Kitchen work triangle appears inefficient—stove and sink placement might hinder movement.
- Timestamp 00:18 - 00:22: Bedroom windows are positioned for optimal ventilation but may require shading solutions for privacy.
- Analysis: The design is visually appealing but needs ergonomic improvements in the kitchen layout.
